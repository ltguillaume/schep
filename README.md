A bucket for [Scoop](https://scoop.sh) with custom(ized) manifests for increased portability, specific application flavors or otherwise missing applications.

## How do I install these manifests?

After manifests have been committed and pushed, run the following:

```pwsh
scoop bucket add schep https://github.com/ltguillaume/schep
scoop install schep/<manifestname>
```

## How do I contribute new manifests?

To make a new manifest contribution, please read the [Contributing

## Update tip

Create a new shortcut (.lnk file) with the following command to quickly update all apps and clean up Scoop:
```
cmd.exe /k scoop update update * && scoop cleanup * && scoop cache rm * && pause && exit
```
